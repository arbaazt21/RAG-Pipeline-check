I\\nhave endeavoured to explain the great fundamental truths of your mind in\\nthe simplest language possible. I believe that it is perfectly possible to\\nexplain the basic, foundational and fundamental laws of life and of your\\nmind in ordinary everyday language. You will find that the language of this\\nbook is that that used in your daily papers, current periodicals, in your\\nbusiness offices, in your home, and in the daily workshop. I urge you to\\nstudy this book and apply the techniques outlined therein; and as you do, I\\nfeel absolutely convinced that you will lay hold of a miracle-working power\\nthat will lift you up from confusion, misery, melancholy and failure, and\\nguide you to your true place, solve your difficulties, sever you from\\nemotional and physical bondage, and place you on the royal road to\\nfreedom, happiness and peace of mind. This miracle-working power of your\\nsubconscious mind can heal you of your sickness, make you vital and\\nstrong again. In learning how to use your inner powers, you will open the\\nprison door of fear and enter into a life described by Paul as the glorious\\nliberty of the sons of god.\\nReleasing the miracle-working power\\nA personal healing will ever be the most convincing evidence of our\\nsubconscious powers. Over forty-two years ago, I resolved a malignancy; in\\nmedical terminology, it was called a sarcoma by using the healing power of\\nmy subconscious mind, which created me and still maintains and governs\\nall my vital functions. The technique I applied is elaborated on in this book,\\nand I feel sure that it will help others to trust the same Infinite Healing\\nPresence lodged in the subconscious depths of all men. Through the kindly\\noffices of my doctor friend, I suddenly realized that it was natural to assume\\nthat the Creative Intelligence, which made all my organs, fashioned my\\nbody and started my heart, could heal its own handiwork.

For example, you choose your\\nbooks, your home and your partner in life. You make all your decisions with\\nyour conscious mind. On the other hand, without any conscious choice on\\nyour part, your heart is kept functioning automatically, and the process of\\ndigestion, circulation and breathing are carried on by your subconscious\\nmind through processes independent of your conscious control.\\nYour subconscious mind accepts what is impressed upon it or what you\\nconsciously believe. It does not reason things out like your conscious mind,\\nand it does not argue with you controversially. Your subconscious mind is\\nlike the soil, which accepts any kind of seed, good or bad. Your thoughts are\\nactive and might be likened unto seeds. Negative, destructive thoughts\\ncontinue to work negatively in your subconscious mind, and in due time\\nwill come forth into outer experience which corresponds with them.\\nRemember, your subconscious mind does not engage in proving\\nwhether your thoughts are good or bad, true or false, but it responds\\naccording to the nature of your thoughts or suggestions. For example, if you\\nconsciously assume something as true, even though it may be false, your\\nsubconscious mind will accept it as true and proceed to bring about results\\nwhich must necessarily follow, because you consciously assumed it to be\\ntrue.\\nExperiments by psychologists\\n29'),\n",

The Chicago friend, not\\nconsidering the difference in time between Chicago and New York, tells the\\nNew Yorker that he is hungry and that he must go to lunch.’\\nAutosuggestion may be used to banish various fears and other negative\\nconditions. A young singer was invited to give an audition. She had been\\nlooking forward to the interview, but on three previous occasions, she had\\nfailed miserably due to fear of failure. This young lady had a very good\\nvoice, but she had been saying to herself, ‘When the time comes for me to\\nsing, maybe they won’t like me. I will try, but I’m full of fear and anxiety.’\\nHer subconscious mind accepted these negative autosuggestions as a\\nrequest and proceeded to manifest them and bring them into her experience.\\nThe cause was an involuntary autosuggestion, i.e. silent fear thoughts\\nemotionalized and subjectified.\\nShe overcame it by the following technique: Three times a day she\\nisolated herself in a room. She sat down comfortably in an armchair,\\nrelaxed her body, and closed her eyes. She stilled her mind and body as best\\nshe could.

This is a simple easy way of conveying the idea of perfect health to\\nyour subconscious mind.\\nAnother wonderful way to convey the idea of health to your\\nsubconscious is through disciplined or scientific imagination. I told a man\\nwho was suffering from functional paralysis to make a vivid picture of\\nhimself walking around in his office, touching the desk, answering the\\ntelephone, and doing all the things he ordinarily would do if he were healed.\\nI explained to him that this idea and mental picture of perfect health would\\nbe accepted by his subconscious mind.\\nHe lived the role and actually felt himself back in the office. He knew\\nthat he was giving his subconscious mind something definite to work upon.\\nHis subconscious mind was the film upon which the picture was impressed.\\nOne day, after several weeks of frequent conditioning of the mind with this\\nmental picture, the telephone rang by prearrangement and kept ringing\\nwhile his wife and nurse were out. The telephone was about twelve feet\\naway, but nevertheless he managed to answer it. He was healed at that hour.\\nThe healing power of his subconscious mind responded to his mental\\nimagery, and a healing followed.

The answer is that this\\nhealing power is in the subconscious mind of each person, and a changed\\nmental attitude on the part of the sick person releases this healing power.\\nNo mental or religious science practitioner, psychologist, psychiatrist,\\nor medical doctor ever healed a patient. There is an old saying, ‘The doctor\\ndresses the wound, but god heals it.’ The psychologist or psychiatrist\\nproceeds to remove the mental blocks in the patient so that the healing\\nprinciple may be released, restoring the patient to health. Likewise, the\\nsurgeon removes the physical block enabling the healing currents to\\nfunction normally. No physician, surgeon, or mental science practitioner\\nclaims that ‘he healed the patient’. The one healing power is called by many\\nnames: nature, life, god, creative intelligence, and subconscious power.\\nAs previously outlined, there are many different methods used to\\nremove the mental, emotional, and physical blocks which inhibit the flow of\\nthe healing life principle animating all of us.

Your subconscious will heal the burn or cut on your\\nhand even though you profess to be an atheist or agnostic.\\nThe modern mental therapeutic procedure is based on the truth that the\\ninfinite intelligence and power of your subconscious mind responds\\naccording to your faith. The mental science practitioner or minister follows\\nthe injunction of the Bible, i.e., he goes into his closet and shuts the door,\\nwhich means he stills his mind, relaxes, let’s go, and thinks of the infinite\\nhealing presence within him.

Shortly\\nafterwards, Dr Braid of Manchester undertook to show that magnetic fluid\\nhad nothing to do with the production of the healings of Dr Mesmer. Dr\\nBraid discovered that patients could be thrown into hypnotic sleep by\\nsuggestion, during which many of the well-known phenomena ascribed to\\nmagnetism by Mesmer could be produced.\\nYou can readily see that all these cures were undoubtedly brought about\\nby the active imagination of the patients together with a powerful\\nsuggestion of health to their subconscious minds. All this could be termed\\nblind faith, as there was no understanding in those days as to how the cures\\nwere brought about.\\nSubjective faith and what it means\\nYou will recall the proposition, which need not be repeated at length, that\\nthe subjective or subconscious mind of an individual is as amenable to the\\ncontrol of his own conscious or objective mind as it is by the suggestions of\\nanother. It follows that whatever may be your objective belief, if you will\\nassume to have faith actively or passively, your subconscious mind will be\\ncontrolled by the suggestion, and your desire will be fulfilled.\\nThe faith required in mental healings is a purely subjective faith, and it\\nis attainable upon the cessation of active opposition on the part of the\\nobjective or conscious mind.\\nIn the healing of the body, it is, of course, desirable to secure the\\nconcurrent faith of both the conscious and subconscious mind. However, it\\nis not always essential if you will enter into a state of passivity and\\nreceptivity by relaxing the mind and the body and getting into a sleepy\\nstate.

Then, in a quiet,\\npassive, receptive way, by reflection, he would convey the idea to the\\nsubconscious.

The significance to her of these words meant that infinite\\nintelligence operating through the laws of her subconscious mind would\\nbring about a harmonious adjustment through the principle of harmony. She\\ncontinued this procedure every night for about ten nights. After she got into\\na sleepy state, she would affirm slowly, quietly, and feelingly the statement:\\n‘It is finished in divine order,’ over and over again, feeling a sense of inner\\npeace and an all-pervading tranquility; then she went off into her deep,\\nnormal sleep.

A harmonious\\nagreement was reached, and litigation was discontinued.\\nThe sleeping technique\\nBy entering into a sleepy, drowsy state, effort is reduced to a minimum. The\\nconscious mind is submerged to a great extent when in a sleepy state. The\\nreason for this is that the highest degree of outcropping of the subconscious\\noccurs prior to sleep and just after we awaken. In this state the negative\\nthoughts, which tend to neutralize your desire and so prevent acceptance by\\nyour subconscious mind, are no longer present.\\nSuppose you want to get rid of a destructive habit.

Some extraordinary results follow this simple\\nmethod of prayer. The thankful heart is always close to the creative forces\\nof the universe, causing countless blessings to flow toward it by the law of\\nreciprocal relationship, based on a cosmic law of action and reaction.\\nFor instance, a father promises his son a car for graduation; the boy has\\nnot yet received the car, but he is very thankful and happy, and is as joyous\\nas though he had actually received the car. He knows his father will fulfil\\nhis promise, and he is full of gratitude and joy even though he has not yet\\nreceived the car, objectively speaking. He has, however, received it with joy\\nand thankfulness in his mind.\\nI shall illustrate how Mr Broke applied this technique with excellent\\nresults. He said, ‘Bills are piling up, I am out of work, I have three children\\nand no money. What shall I do?’ Regularly every night and morning, for a\\nperiod of about three weeks, he repeated the words, ‘Thank you, Father, for\\nmy wealth,’ in a relaxed, peaceful manner until the feeling or mood of\\nthankfulness dominated his mind. He imagined he was addressing the\\ninfinite power and intelligence within him knowing, of course, that he could\\nnot see the creative intelligence or infinite mind. He was seeing with the\\ninner eye of spiritual perception, realizing that his thought-image of wealth\\nwas the first cause, relative to the money, position, and food he needed. His\\nthought-feeling was the substance of wealth untrammeled by antecedent\\nconditions of any kind. By repeating, ‘Thank you, Father,’ over and over\\nagain, his mind and heart were lifted up to the point of acceptance, and\\nwhen fear, thoughts of lack, poverty, and distress came into his mind, he\\nwould say, ‘Thank you, Father,’ as often as necessary. He knew that as he\\nkept up the thankful attitude he would recondition his mind to the idea of\\nwealth, which is what happened.\\nThe sequel to his prayer is very interesting. After praying in the above-\\nmentioned manner, he met a former employer of his on the street whom he\\nhad not seen for twenty years. The man offered him a very lucrative\\n88'),\n",

Today, Mr Broke is\\nvice-president of the company for which he works. His recent remark to me\\nwas, ‘I shall never forget the wonders of “Thank you, Father”. It has\\nworked wonders for me.’\\nThe affirmative method\\nThe effectiveness of an affirmation is determined largely by your\\nunderstanding of the truth and the meaning back of the words, ‘In praying\\nuse not vain repetition.’ Therefore, the power of your affirmation lies in the\\nintelligent application of definite and specific positives. For example, a boy\\nadds three and three and puts down seven on the blackboard. The teacher\\naffirms with mathematical certainty that three and three are six; therefore,\\nthe boy changes his figures accordingly. The teacher’s statement did not\\nmake three and three equal six because the latter was already a\\nmathematical truth. The mathematical truth caused the boy to rearrange the\\nfigures on the blackboard. It is abnormal to be sick; it is normal to be\\nhealthy. Health is the truth of your being. When you affirm health, harmony,\\nand peace for yourself or another, and when you realize these are universal\\nprinciples of your own being, you will rearrange the negative patterns of\\nyour subconscious mind based on your faith and understanding of that\\nwhich you affirm.\\nThe result of the affirmative process of prayer depends on your\\nconforming to the principles of life, regardless of appearances. Consider for\\na moment that there is a principle of mathematics and none of error; there is\\na principle of truth but none of dishonesty. There is a principle of\\nintelligence but none of ignorance; there is a principle of harmony and none\\nof discord. There is a principle of health but none of disease, and there is a\\nprinciple of abundance but none of poverty.\\nThe affirmative method was chosen by the author for use on his sister\\nwho was to be operated on for the removal of gallstones in a hospital in\\nEngland.

In\\nbrief, the argumentative method employed according to Quimby consists of\\nspiritual reasoning where you convince the patient and yourself that his\\nsickness is due to his false belief, groundless fears, and negative patterns\\nlodged in his subconscious mind. You reason it out clearly in your mind and\\nconvince your patient that the disease or ailment is due only to a distorted,\\ntwisted pattern of thought, which has taken form in his body. This wrong\\nbelief in some external power and external causes has now externalized\\nitself as sickness, and can be changed by changing the thought patterns.\\nYou explain to the sick person that the basis of all healing is a change of\\nbelief. You also point out that the subconscious mind created the body and\\nall its organs; therefore, it knows how to heal it, can heal it, and is doing so\\nnow as you speak. You argue in the courtroom of your mind that the disease\\nis a shadow of the mind based on disease-soaked, morbid thought-imagery.\\nYou continue to build up all the evidence you can muster on behalf of the\\nhealing power within, which created all the organs in the first place, and\\nwhich has a perfect pattern of every cell, nerve, and tissue within it Then,\\nyou render a verdict in the courthouse of your mind in favor of yourself or\\nyour patient.

Dr Quimby\\ndiagnosed her case as a mind cloudy and stagnated, due to excitation and\\nfear, caused by the inability to see clearly the meaning of the passage of the\\nBible, which she had been reading. This showed itself in the body by her\\nheavy and sluggish feeling which would terminate as paralysis.\\nAt this point Quimby asked her what was meant in the Bible verses:\\n‘Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto Him that sent me. Ye\\nshall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot\\ncome.’ [JOHN 7:33-34] She replied that it meant Jesus went to heaven.\\nQuimby explained what it really meant by telling her that being with her a\\nlittle while meant his explanation of her symptoms, feelings, and their\\ncauses; i.e., he had compassion and sympathy for her momentarily, but he\\ncould not remain in that mental state. The next step was ‘to go to Him that\\nsent us’ which, as Quimby pointed out, was the creative power of god in all\\nof us.\\nQuimby immediately traveled in his mind and contemplated the divine\\nideal; i.e., the vitality, intelligence, harmony, and power of god functioning\\nin the sick person.

She walked without her\\ncrutches! Quimby said it was one of the most singular of all his healings.\\nShe was, as it were, dead to error, and to bring her to life or truth was to\\nraise her from the dead. Quimby quoted the resurrection of Christ and\\napplied it to her own Christ or health; this produced a powerful effect on\\nher.

It is the channel of that mental action, which\\nunconsciously supports the vital functions of the body.\\nThe two systems may work separately or synchronously. Judge Thomas\\nTroward, The Edinburgh Lectures on Mental Science  (New York: Robert\\nMcBride & Co., 1909), says, ‘The vagus nerve passes out of the cerebral\\nregion as a portion of the voluntary system, and through it, we control the\\nvocal organs; then it passes onward to the thorax, sending out branches to\\nthe heart and lungs; finally, passing through the diaphragm, it loses the\\nouter coating which distinguishes the nerves of the voluntary system and\\nbecomes identified with those of the sympathetic system, so forming a\\nconnecting link between the two and making the man physically a single\\nentity.’\\n99'),\n",

Try to solve it with your conscious mind. Think how happy you\\nwould be about the perfect solution. Sense the feeling you would have if the\\nperfect answer were yours now. Let your mind play with this mood in a\\nrelaxed way; then drop off to sleep. When you awaken, and you do not have\\nthe answer, get busy about something else.

Remarkable answers are given to you while you are asleep.\\nWhy we sleep\\nDr John Bigelow, a famous research authority on sleep (Dr John Bigelow,\\nThe Mystery of Sleep [New York and London: Haiper Brothers, 1903],\\ndemonstrated that at night while asleep you receive impressions showing\\nthat the nerves of the eyes, ears, nose and taste buds are active during sleep,\\nand also that the nerves of your brain are quite active.

By claiming guidance, strength, and\\ngreater intelligence in all phases of your life, you will be enabled to\\novercome all difficulties and solve your daily problems.\\nThis regular withdrawal from sense evidence and the noise and\\nconfusion of everyday living is also a form of sleep, i.e., you become asleep\\nto the world of the senses and alive to the wisdom and power of your\\nsubconscious mind.\\nStartling effects of sleep deprivation\\nLack of sleep can cause you to become irritable, moody, and depressed. Dr\\nGeorge Stevenson of the National Association for Mental Health says, ‘I\\nbelieve it can safely be said that all human beings need a minimum of six\\nhours of sleep to be healthy. Most people need more. Those who think they\\ncan get along on less are fooling themselves.’\\nMedical research scholars, investigating sleep processes and deprivation\\nof sleep, point out that severe insomnia has preceded psychotic breakdown\\nin some instances.

To think that others can mar your happiness, that you are the\\nfootball of a cruel fate, that you must oppose and fight others for a living all\\nthese and others like them are untenable when you understand that thoughts\\nare things. The Bible says the same thing. ‘For as a man thinketh in his\\nheart, so is he.’ [PROV 23:7]\\nSummary of your aids to forgiveness\\n1. God, or Life, is no respecter of persons. Life plays no favorites. Life,\\nor god, seems to favor you when you align yourself with the principle\\nof harmony, health, joy, and peace.\\n2.

If you\\nreally believe in a god of love, your subconscious mind will respond in\\ncountless blessings to you. Believe in a god of love.\\n4. Life, or god, holds no grudge against you.

He knew that his\\ndestructive habit was automatic, but since it was acquired through his\\nconscious choice, he realized that if he had been conditioned negatively, he\\nalso could be conditioned positively.

If you are\\nafraid of swimming, begin now to sit still for five or ten minutes three or\\nfour times a day, and imagine you are swimming. Actually, you are\\nswimming in your mind. It is a subjective experience. Mentally you have\\nprojected yourself into the water. You feel the chill of the water and the\\nmovement of your arms and legs. It is all real, vivid, and a joyous activity\\nof the mind. It is not idle daydreaming, for you know that what you are\\nexperiencing in your imagination will be developed in your subconscious\\nmind. Then you will be compelled to express the image and likeness of the\\npicture you impressed on your deeper mind. This is the law of the\\nsubconscious.\\nYou could apply the same technique if you are afraid of mountains or\\nhigh places.

He would walk up five flights of stairs to his office every morning.\\nHe said that he began to bless the elevator every night and several times a\\nday. He finally overcame his fear. This was how he blessed the elevator:\\n‘The elevator in our building is a wonderful idea. It came out of the\\nuniversal mind. It is a boon and a blessing to all our employees. It gives\\nwonderful service. It operates in divine order. I ride in it in peace and joy.
